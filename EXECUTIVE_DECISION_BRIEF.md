- Close Series A funding round

## Executive Summary

STOQ stands at a critical inflection point. The protocol has strong foundations (B+ grade) but requires transformative investment to achieve market leadership (A++ grade). The $5M investment will yield:

- **Technical Leadership**: First quantum-resistant 10+ Gbps protocol
- **Market Position**: Dominant player in $15B market segment
- **Financial Returns**: 9x ROI over 5 years (conservative case)
- **Strategic Value**: Standards influence and acquisition optionality

The 18-24 month market window for establishing protocol leadership is closing rapidly. Organizations that move now will define the networking standards for the quantum era. Those that wait will be forced to adopt others' standards.

**The decision is not whether to invest in quantum-safe networking, but whether to lead or follow.**
