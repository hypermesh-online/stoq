# STOQ Implementation Priority Matrix
## Execution Guide for 100% Completion

**Purpose**: Define clear priorities and dependencies for parallel execution
**Method**: Impact vs Effort analysis with dependency mapping
**Timeline**: 12-month execution plan with parallel streams

## Priority Classification

### P0 - Critical Path (Must Complete First)
These items block all other work and must be completed sequentially.

| Task | Impact | Effort | Duration | Dependency | Agent |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Phoenix SDK Extraction | 10/10 | 3/10 | 2 weeks | None | ops-developer |
| Monitoring Removal | 9/10 | 2/10 | 1 week | Phoenix done | ops-developer |
| Clean Architecture Validation | 10/10 | 2/10 | 1 week | Monitoring done | ops-qa |

**Rationale**: Cannot proceed with protocol work until contamination removed

### P1 - High Priority (Core Protocol)
Essential protocol features that define STOQ's value proposition.

| Task | Impact | Effort | Duration | Dependency | Agent |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Packet Header Design | 10/10 | 5/10 | 2 weeks | Clean arch | ops-integration |
| Extension Integration | 9/10 | 7/10 | 4 weeks | Headers done | ops-developer |
| FALCON Handshake | 10/10 | 8/10 | 4 weeks | Clean arch | ops-developer |
| eBPF Infrastructure | 9/10 | 9/10 | 4 weeks | Clean arch | system-admin |

**Rationale**: Core differentiators that make STOQ unique

### P2 - Medium Priority (Performance)
Performance optimizations that achieve target metrics.

| Task | Impact | Effort | Duration | Dependency | Agent |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Zero-Copy Paths | 8/10 | 6/10 | 2 weeks | eBPF ready | ops-developer |
| Live Adaptation | 7/10 | 7/10 | 3 weeks | Extensions done | ops-developer |
| Connection Pooling | 6/10 | 4/10 | 1 week | Clean arch | ops-developer |
| Frame Batching | 7/10 | 5/10 | 2 weeks | eBPF ready | ops-developer |

**Rationale**: Performance features that enable 10+ Gbps target

### P3 - Lower Priority (Polish)
Production readiness and quality improvements.

| Task | Impact | Effort | Duration | Dependency | Agent |
|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Security Audit | 8/10 | 3/10 | 2 weeks | All features | ops-qa |
| Documentation | 6/10 | 4/10 | 2 weeks | All features | ops-developer |
| Compatibility Testing | 7/10 | 5/10 | 2 weeks | All features | ops-qa |
| Performance Validation | 8/10 | 4/10 | 2 weeks | All features | ops-qa |

**Rationale**: Required for production but not for functionality
